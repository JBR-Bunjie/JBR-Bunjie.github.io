# hashing table

[What is Hashing? How Hash Codes Work - with Examples (freecodecamp.org)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-hashing/)

In hash tables, you store data in forms of key and value pairs. The key, which is used to identify the data, is given as an input to the hashing function. The hash code, which is an integer, is then mapped to the fixed size we have.


Hash tables have to support 3 functions.

- insert (key, value)
- get (key)
- delete (key)
