# 依赖项管理：Requirements.txt, Setup.py及更多



## Write a setup.py

> remember what you use, or try to use some tools to control the dependenies efficiently and fine

Yes, we can write this file in multiple ways - python is a script language after all.

However, what's the most imporant part?

I think we should follow the codes below:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages()
setup(
    # metadata with info
    name='SetupFileExample',
    version='0.1',
    author='JBR',
    author_email='jbr@example.com',
    packages=find_packages(),
    description='Useful towel-related stuff.',
    # dependencies 
    install_requires=[
        "Django >= 1.1.1",
        "caldav == 0.1.4",
    ],
)
```

As for metadata, you can use this chart:

and, the next one is a problem: how can we remember the packages we installed thousands of years ago?

well, thanks to the pip-tools we list at link4 - Link below, we can clearly see the main dependencies and decide which to list. With that, we can figure out what's important

## Why we need setup.py even if requirements.txt already exists?

see link3 - it's pretty nice!
