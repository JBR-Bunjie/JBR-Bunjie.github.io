## Light Casters - 投光物

>All the lighting we've used so far came from a single source that is a single point in space. It gives good results, but in the real world we have several types of light that each act different. A light source that *casts* light upon objects is called a light caster. In this chapter we'll discuss several different types of light casters. Learning to simulate different light sources is yet another tool in your toolbox to further enrich your environments.

>We'll first discuss a directional light, then a point light which is an extension of what we had before, and lastly we'll discuss spotlights. In the [next](https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Multiple-lights) chapter we'll combine several of these different light types into one scene.

## Directional Light

> 示例：太阳光

光源的作用效果只受光源摆放角度的影响，摆放的具体位置一般不会对Directional Light造成影响

> 只有一个点的Directional Light和Point Light的区别：
>
> Point Light的效果会随着距离而衰减，但Directional Light不会，这也是它们效果不同的直接成因







## Point Lights

> 示例：无罩电灯泡

光源的作用效果同时受摆放的角度和位置的影响







### Attenuation



#### Choosing the right values



#### Implementing attenuation



## Spotlight

> 示例：舞台聚光灯

光源的作用效果同时受摆放的角度和位置的影响





## Flashlight



## Smooth/Soft edges
