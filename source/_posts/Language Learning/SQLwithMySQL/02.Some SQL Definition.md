SQL: Structured Query Language, which contains four part:

- DDL，Data Defination Language——数据定义语言
- DML，Data Manipulation Language——数据操作语言
- DQL，Data Query Language——数据查询语言
- DCL，Data Control Language——数据控制语言

## DDL

[DDL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/features-of-structured-query-language-sql/) or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data. These commands are normally not used by a general user, who should be accessing the database via an application.

List of DDL commands: 

### [**CREATE**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-create/)
This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).

There are two CREATE statements available in SQL:

1. CREATE DATABASE
2. CREATE TABLE
2. CREATE USER

```mysql
create database <database_name>;  # create new database with name: database_name

create table <table_name>(
    <column_name_1> <data_type>[constraints_for_column] primary key <default_value>,
    <column_name_2> <data_type>[constraints_for_column] <default_value>,
    <column_name_3> <data_type>[constraints_for_column] <default_value>,
    ...
    [constraints_for_table] primary key(<column_name_x>, )
);  # create new table with name: table_name

CREATE USER <user_account> IDENTIFIED BY <user_password>;
```

Unfortunately, We can't create database in custom folder, unless we change the datadir, which is not worth the time it'll cost.

### [**DROP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-drop-truncate/)
This command is used to delete objects from the database or database itself.

The DROP statement destroys the objects like an existing database, table, index, or view. A DROP statement in SQL removes a component from a relational database management system (RDBMS).

```mysql
drop database <database_name>;  # delete the database 

DROP TABLE <table_name>;  # delete the table 
```

### [**TRUNCATE**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-drop-truncate/)

This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.

```mysql
TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>;
```

### Compare `truncate` with `drop`

- Truncate is normally ultra-fast and its ideal for deleting data from a temporary table.
- Truncate preserves the structure of the table for future use, unlike drop table where the table is deleted with its full structure.
- Table or Database deletion using DROP statement **cannot** be rolled back, so it must be used wisely.

### [**ALTER**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-alter-add-drop-modify/) 

This is used to alter the structure of the database.

As a powerful command, alter can add, delete/drop or modify columns in the existing table. It can also add and drop various constraints on the existing table.

#### RENAME

This is used to rename an object existing in the database.

```mysql
alter table <table_name> rename [To] <new_table_name>  # change table name
# the [To] is an optional parameter which affect nothing
```

#### ALTER TABLE – ADD

ADD is used to add columns into the existing table. Sometimes we may require to add additional information, in that case we do not require to create the whole database again, ADD comes to our rescue.

```mysql
ALTER TABLE <table_name> ADD (
    Columnname_1  datatype, 
    Columnname_2  datatype,         
    …
    Columnname_n  datatype
);
```

#### ALTER TABLE – DROP

DROP COLUMN is used to drop column in a table. Deleting the unwanted columns from the table.

```mysql
ALTER TABLE <table_name> DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

#### ALTER TABLE-MODIFY

It is used to modify the existing columns in a table. Multiple columns can also be modified at once.
Syntax may vary slightly in different databases.

**Oracle,MySQL,MariaDB:**

```mysql
ALTER TABLE <table_name> MODIFY column_name column_type;
```

**SQL Server:**

```mysql
ALTER TABLE <table_name> ALTER COLUMN column_name column_type;
```



### [**COMMENT**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-comments/)
This is used to add comments to the data dictionary.

there are two types of comments in sql

```mysql
# 1. single line comment
# -- anything or #anything
# notice! if you choose to use "--", you should add a space after those two "-"
-- anything
#anything

# 2. mutli line comment and in line comment
# /*anything*/
/*anything*/ 
SELECT * FROM /* Customers; */ 
```



## DML

The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statements.

List of DML commands: 

### [INSERT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-insert-statement/)

The INSERT INTO statement of SQL is used to insert a new row in a table. 

There are two ways of using INSERT INTO statement for inserting **rows**:

- **Only values:** First method is to specify only the value of data to be inserted without the column names.

```mysql
INSERT INTO <table_name> VALUES (value1, value2, value3,…);
# table_name: name of the table.
# value1, value2,.. : value of first column, second column,… for the new record
```

- **Column names and values both:** In the second method we will specify both the columns which we want to fill and their corresponding values as shown below:

```mysql
INSERT INTO <table_name> (column1, column2, column3, ...) VALUES ( value1, value2, value3, ...);
# table_name: name of the table.
# column1: name of first column, second column …
# value1, value2, value3 : value of first column, second column,… for the new record

# in this method, we can insert data for specific columns which means we might see blanks in some columns
```



### [UPDATE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-update-statement/)

The UPDATE statement in SQL is used to update the data of an existing table in database. 

We can update single columns as well as multiple columns using UPDATE statement as per our requirement.

```mysql
UPDATE <table_name> SET column1 = value1[, column2 = value2,...] [WHERE condition];

# table_name: name of the table
# column1: name of first , second, third column....
# value1: new value for first, second, third column....
# condition: condition to select the rows for which the values of columns needs to be updated.
	# If we have not used the WHERE clause then the columns in all the rows will be updated

# Example: UPDATE Student SET NAME = 'PRATIK' WHERE Age = 20;
```



### [DELETE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-delete-statement/)

The DELETE Statement in SQL is used to delete existing records from a table. 

We can delete a single record or multiple records depending on the condition we specify in the WHERE clause.

```mysql
DELETE FROM <table_name> [WHERE condition];

# table_name: name of the table
# condition: condition to choose particular record.
	# If we omit the WHERE clause then all of the records will be deleted and the table will be empty which is same as:
	# DELETE * FROM Student
```



### [LOCK](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-lock-table/)

Table control concurrency.

### CALL

Call a PL/SQL or JAVA subprogram.

### EXPLAIN PLAN

It describes the access path to data.

## DQL

**DQL** statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. We can define DQL as follows it is a component of SQL statement that allows getting data from the database and imposing order upon it. It includes the SELECT statement. This command allows getting the data out of the database to perform operations with it. When a SELECT is fired against a table or tables the result is compiled into a further temporary table, which is displayed or perhaps received by the program i.e. a front-end.

### [**SELECT**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-select-clause/)

SELECT is used to retrieve data from the database.

```mysql
SELECT <column_name>[, ..., <column_name_x>] FROM <table_name> 
# column1,column2: names of the fields of the table
# table_name: from where we want to fetch

# To fetch all the fields from the table:
SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
```



## DCL

DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system. 

List of  DCL commands: 

### [GRANT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mysql-grant-revoke-privileges/)

This command gives users access privileges to the database.

> We can easily create user in MySQL using [MySQL | create user statement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mysql-create-user-statement/). But using the Create User Statement only creates a new user but does not grant any privileges to the user account.Therefore to grant privileges to a user account, the GRANT statement is used.

```mysql
GRANT <privileges_name> ON <object_name> TO {user_name | public | role_name} ;

# privileges_name: These are the access rights or privileges granted to the user.
# object:It is the name of the database object to which permissions are being granted. In the case of granting privileges on a table, this would be the table name.
# user:It is the name of the user to whom the privileges would be granted.

# example1——Granting SELECT Privilege to a User in a Table: 
	# GRANT SELECT ON Users TO 'Amit'@'localhost;
# example2——Granting more than one Privilege to a User in a Table: 
	# GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE ON Users TO 'Amit'@'localhost;
# example3——Granting All the Privilege to a User in a Table: 
	# GRANT ALL ON Users TO 'Amit'@'localhost;
# example4——Granting a Privilege to all Users in a Table: 
	# GRANT SELECT ON Users TO '*'@'localhost;
```

### [REVOKE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-grant-and-revoke/) 

This command withdraws the user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.

```mysql
revoke <privilege_name> on <object_name> from {user_name | public | role_name}
	# revoke insert, select on accounts from Ram
```



## TCL 

Because many resources claim there to be another category of SQL clauses TCL – Transaction Control Language. So we will see in detail about TCL as well. TCL commands deal with the [transaction within the database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-transactions/). 

Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit. Each transaction begins with a specific task and ends when all the tasks in the group successfully complete. If any of the tasks fail, the transaction fails. Therefore, a transaction has only two results: **success** or **failure**. 

Following commands are used to control transactions. It is important to note that these statements cannot be used while creating tables and are only used with the DML Commands such as – INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. 

### BEGIN TRANSACTION

```mysql
BEGIN TRANSACTION [<transaction_name>];
```

### [SET TRANSACTION](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-transactions/) 

Specify characteristics for the transaction.

```mysql
SET TRANSACTION [ READ WRITE | READ ONLY ];
```

### [COMMIT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-transactions/)

Commits a Transaction——If everything is in order with all statements within a single transaction, all changes are recorded together in the database is called **committed**. 

The COMMIT command saves all the transactions to the database since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK command. 

```mysql
COMMIT;
```

### [ROLLBACK](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-transactions/)

Rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs——If any error occurs with any of the SQL grouped statements, all changes need to be aborted. The process of reversing changes is called **rollback**. 

This command can only be used to undo transactions since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK command was issued. 

```mysql
ROLLBACK;
# ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT_NAME
```

### [SAVEPOINT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-transactions/)

Sets a savepoint within a transaction——creates points within the groups of transactions in which to ROLLBACK. 

A SAVEPOINT is a point in a transaction in which you can roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction

```mysql
SAVEPOINT <SAVEPOINT_NAME>;
```

### RELEASE SAVEPOINT

This command is used to remove a SAVEPOINT that you have created. 

```mysql
RELEASE SAVEPOINT <SAVEPOINT_NAME>;
```
