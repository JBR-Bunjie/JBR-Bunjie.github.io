# Vim 6. Navigation

## 移动光标

| 具体按键 | 描述 Description                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **h**    | 左移 Move cursor to left by one position         |

| **k**    | 上移 Move cursor to upward direction by one line |
| **l**    | 右移 Move cursor to right direction by one line  |

可以通过数字键+移动键实现快速移动，如向下移动十行：

To perform multi-position navigation use number with these commands. For instance to navigate cursor 10 line below from current line, execute following command −

```bash
10j # 先按数字键1 0 后按 j
```

有一些特殊"数字"：
| command | Description |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **0** | Move cursor to the beginning of current line |
| **$** | Move cursor to the end of current line |
| **Ctrl + f** | Scroll down entire page |
| **Ctrl + b** | Scroll up entire page |

## Navigate to lines

Below command can be used to navigate to specific line −

| Command           | Description               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **:[lineNumber]** | Jump to the certain line  |
| **:0**            | Jump to the start of file |
| **:$**            | Jump to the end of file   |

## Word navigation

We can use following commands for word navigation −

| Command | Description                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **w**   | Move cursor to the beginning of the next word     |
| **e**   | Move cursor to the end of the current word        |
| **b**   | Move cursor to the beginning of the previous word |

## Using jumps

Vim keeps track of your navigation using a jump list. You can go backward and forward through that list.

The jump list keeps tracks of all the places you’ve been to by tracking file name, line number and column number.

To view jump list execute following command −

```
:jumps
```

Following command are based on jump list −

| Command      | Description                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Ctrl + o** | Jump back to the previous position |
| **Ctrl + i** | Jump to the next position          |

## 退出`:jumps`

一般不要使用:q 作退出！很可能直接关闭文件！
