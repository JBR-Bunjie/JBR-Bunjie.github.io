It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model\">client-server model</a>, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol\">stateless protocol</a>, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"Overview\"><a href=\"#Overview\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Overview:\"></a>Overview:</h2><p><img src=\"http-layers.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Components-of-HTTP-based-systems\"><a href=\"#Components-of-HTTP-based-systems\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Components of HTTP-based systems\"></a><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#components_of_http-based_systems\">Components of HTTP-based systems</a></h2><p>HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the <strong>user-agent</strong> (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example, a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.</p>\n<p>Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer called the <em>response</em>. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Proxy_server\"><strong>proxies</strong></a>, <em>which perform different operations and act as gateways or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cache\">caches</a></em>, for example<img src=\"client-server-chain.png\" alt=\"Client server chain\"></p>\n<p>In reality, there are more computers between a browser and the server handling the request: there are routers, modems, and more. Thanks to the layered design of the Web, these are hidden in the network and transport layers. HTTP is on top, at the application layer. Although important for diagnosing network problems, the underlying layers are mostly irrelevant to the description of HTTP.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Client-the-user-agent\"><a href=\"#Client-the-user-agent\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Client: the user-agent\"></a><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#client_the_user-agent\">Client: the user-agent</a></h3><p>The <em>user-agent</em> is any tool that acts on behalf of the user. This role is primarily performed by the Web browser, but it may also be performed by programs used by engineers and Web developers to debug their applications.</p>\n<p>The browser is <strong>always</strong> the entity initiating the request. It is never the server (though some mechanisms have been added over the years to simulate server-initiated messages).</p>\n<p><strong>To display a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch the HTML document that represents the page. It then parses this file, making additional requests corresponding to execution scripts, layout information (CSS) to display, and sub-resources contained within the page (usually images and videos). The Web browser then combines these resources to present the complete document, the Web page. Scripts executed by the browser can fetch more resources in later phases and the browser updates the Web page accordingly.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"The-Web-server\"><a href=\"#The-Web-server\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Web server\"></a><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#the_web_server\">The Web server</a></h3><p>On the opposite side of the communication channel is the server, which <em>serves</em> the document as requested by the client. A server appears as only a single machine virtually; but it may actually be a collection of servers sharing the load (load balancing), or a complex piece of software interrogating other computers (like cache, a DB server, or e-commerce servers), totally or partially generating the document on demand.</p>\n<p>A server is not necessarily a single machine, but several server software instances can be hosted on the same machine. With HTTP/1.1 and the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host\"><code>Host</code></a> header, they may even share the same IP address.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Proxies\"><a href=\"#Proxies\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Proxies\"></a><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#proxies\">Proxies</a></h3><p>Between the Web browser and the server, numerous computers and machines relay the HTTP messages. Due to the layered structure of the Web stack, most of these operate at the transport, network or physical levels, becoming transparent at the HTTP layer and potentially having a significant impact on performance. Those operating at the application layers are generally called <strong>proxies</strong>. These can be transparent, forwarding on the requests they receive without altering them in any way, or non-transparent, in which case they will change the request in some way before passing it along to the server. Proxies may perform numerous functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>caching (the cache can be public or private, like the browser cache)</li>\n<li>filtering (like an antivirus scan or parental controls)</li>\n<li>load balancing (to allow multiple servers to serve different requests)</li>\n<li>authentication (to control access to different resources)</li>\n<li>logging (allowing the storage of historical information)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Basic-aspects-of-HTTP\"><a href=\"#Basic-aspects-of-HTTP\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Basic aspects of HTTP\"></a><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#basic_aspects_of_http\">Basic aspects of HTTP</a></h2><h3 id=\"HTTP-is-simple\"><a href=\"#HTTP-is-simple\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"HTTP is simple\"></a><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_is_simple\">HTTP is simple</a></h3><p>HTTP is generally designed to be simple and human readable, even with the added complexity introduced in HTTP/2 by encapsulating HTTP messages into frames. HTTP messages can be read and understood by humans, providing easier testing for developers, and reduced complexity for newcomers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HTTP-is-extensible\"><a href=\"#HTTP-is-extensible\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"HTTP is extensible\"></a><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_is_extensible\">HTTP is extensible</a></h3><p>Introduced in HTTP/1.0, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers\">HTTP headers</a> make this protocol easy to extend and experiment with. New functionality can even be introduced by a simple agreement between a client and a server about a new header’s semantics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HTTP-is-stateless-but-not-sessionless\"><a href=\"#HTTP-is-stateless-but-not-sessionless\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"HTTP is stateless, but not sessionless\"></a><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_is_stateless_but_not_sessionless\">HTTP is stateless, but not sessionless</a></h3><p>HTTP is stateless: there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same connection. This immediately has the prospect of being problematic for users attempting to interact with certain pages coherently, for example, using e-commerce shopping baskets. But while the core of HTTP itself is stateless, HTTP cookies allow the use of stateful sessions. Using header extensibility, HTTP Cookies are added to the workflow, allowing session creation on each HTTP request to share the same context, or the same state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HTTP-and-connections\"><a href=\"#HTTP-and-connections\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"HTTP and connections\"></a><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_and_connections\">HTTP and connections</a></h3><p>A connection is controlled at the transport layer, and therefore fundamentally out of scope for HTTP. HTTP doesn’t require the underlying transport protocol to be connection-based; it only requires it to be <em>reliable</em>, or not lose messages (at minimum, presenting an error in such cases). Among the two most common transport protocols on the Internet, TCP is reliable and UDP isn’t. HTTP therefore relies on the TCP standard, which is connection-based.</p>\n<p>Before a client and server can exchange an HTTP request/response pair, they must establish a TCP connection, a process which requires several round-trips. The default behavior of HTTP/1.0 is to open a separate TCP connection for each HTTP request/response pair. This is less efficient than sharing a single TCP connection when multiple requests are sent in close succession.</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate this flaw, HTTP/1.1 introduced <em>pipelining</em> (which proved difficult to implement) and <em>persistent connections</em>: the underlying TCP connection can be partially controlled using the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Connection\"><code>Connection</code></a> header. HTTP/2 went a step further by multiplexing messages over a single connection, helping keep the connection warm and more efficient.</p>\n<p>Experiments are in progress to design a better transport protocol more suited to HTTP. For example, Google is experimenting with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC\">QUIC</a> which builds on UDP to provide a more reliable and efficient transport protocol.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview\">An overview of HTTP - HTTP | MDN (mozilla.org)</a></p>\n","text":" Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
