The OSI\r\nmodel characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules\r\nand requirements in order to support interoperability between different\r\nproducts and software. In the OSI reference model, the communications\r\nbetween a computing system are split into seven different abstraction\r\nlayers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation,\r\nand Application.</p>\r\n<p>Created at a time when network computing was in its infancy, the OSI\r\nwas published in 1984 by the International Organization for\r\nStandardization (ISO). Though it does not always map directly to\r\nspecific systems, the OSI Model is still used today as a means to\r\ndescribe Network Architecture.</p>\r\n<h1 id=\"the-7-layers-of-the-osi-model\">The 7 Layers of the OSI\r\nModel</h1>\r\n<h2 id=\"physical-layer\">Physical Layer</h2>\r\n<p>The lowest layer of the OSI Model is concerned with electrically or\r\noptically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network\r\nfrom the physical layer of the sending device to the physical layer of\r\nthe receiving device. It can include specifications such as voltages,\r\npin layout, cabling, and radio frequencies. At the physical layer, one\r\nmight find “physical” resources such as network hubs, cabling,\r\nrepeaters, network adapters or modems.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"data-link-layer\">Data Link Layer</h2>\r\n<p>At the data link layer, directly connected nodes are used to perform\r\nnode-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. The data\r\nlink layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical\r\nlayer.</p>\r\n<p>The data link layer encompasses two sub-layers of its own. The first,\r\nmedia access control (MAC), provides flow control and multiplexing for\r\ndevice transmissions over a network. The second, the logical link\r\ncontrol (LLC), provides flow and error control over the physical medium\r\nas well as identifies line protocols.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"network-layer\">Network Layer</h2>\r\n<p>The network layer is responsible for receiving frames from the data\r\nlink layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among\r\nbased on the addresses contained inside the frame. The network layer\r\nfinds the destination by using logical addresses, such as IP (internet\r\nprotocol). At this layer, routers are a crucial component used to quite\r\nliterally route information where it needs to go between networks.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"transport-layer\">Transport Layer</h2>\r\n<p>The transport layer manages the delivery and error checking of data\r\npackets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer\r\nof data between systems and hosts. One of the most common examples of\r\nthe transport layer is TCP or the Transmission Control Protocol.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"session-layer\">Session Layer</h2>\r\n<p>The session layer controls the conversations between different\r\ncomputers. A session or connection between machines is set up, managed,\r\nand termined at layer 5. Session layer services also include\r\nauthentication and reconnections.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"presentation-layer\">Presentation Layer</h2>\r\n<p>The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application\r\nlayer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts.\r\nBecause of this, it at times also called the syntax layer. This layer\r\ncan also handle the encryption and decryption required by the\r\napplication layer.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"application-layer\">Application Layer</h2>\r\n<p>At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact\r\ndirectly with the software application. This layer sees network services\r\nprovided to end-user applications such as a web browser or Office 365.\r\nThe application layer identifies communication partners, resource\r\navailability, and synchronizes communication.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/osi-model\">What is the\r\nOSI Model?
